In the real world of computer programming it is very rare that a single programmer creates a program from start to finish. Most of the time you are part of a team of programmers all working together on a large project, with each individual programmer being responsible for one or more parts of the larger project. Often you are also put into a project that has already been started by others and you are expected to enhance, fix, or finish it.

This assignment is meant to simulate a real life scenario. You are a programmer who must take the matching game that was started in the content section and are tasked with polishing and finishing the game. For this assignment I will not be assisting you with your code in any way. It is up to you to take all the skills you have learned in all your programming experiences up to this point and apply them to create a final polished product. It is time for you to demonstrate what you can do.

Required Modifications  
Check when all matches are made and change the Output to “Congratulations.” 
The theme of the sample game was “Computer Hardware.”
Personalize this game by changing the images to follow a theme of your own. Note, you may draw your own images or import images such as clip art or digital photos. Change and use different images for all situations. 
Only allow the user to select two cards at a time. They should not be able to continue flipping cards.
Do not let the user flip a card that has already been matched.
